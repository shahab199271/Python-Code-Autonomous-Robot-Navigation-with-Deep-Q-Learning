This Python code implements a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm to train an AI-based autonomous agent (simulated robot) to navigate through a grid environment. The agent learns to move from the start position to the target by interacting with the environment, where it takes actions (up, down, left, right) based on a neural network model that predicts the best action to take in each state. The training process involves the agent exploring different actions and updating its knowledge using a replay memory to store and learn from past experiences. The code also includes functionality to visualize the agent's path during training and to test the trained model in the environment.

This project implements an autonomous robot navigation system using the SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) reinforcement learning algorithm within a 5x5 grid environment. The robot learns to navigate from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the grid by updating its policy based on interactions with the environment. The code includes functionality for training the robot, visualizing the Q-table as a heatmap, and plotting the agent's path and performance metrics such as rewards and steps taken per episode. It also tracks training progress and allows for testing of the trained agent using the saved Q-table.
