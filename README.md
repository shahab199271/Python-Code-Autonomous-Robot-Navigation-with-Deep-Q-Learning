This Python code implements a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm to train an AI-based autonomous agent (simulated robot) to navigate through a grid environment. The agent learns to move from the start position to the target by interacting with the environment, where it takes actions (up, down, left, right) based on a neural network model that predicts the best action to take in each state. The training process involves the agent exploring different actions and updating its knowledge using a replay memory to store and learn from past experiences. The code also includes functionality to visualize the agent's path during training and to test the trained model in the environment.
